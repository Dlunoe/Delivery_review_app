# Delivery Driver App
React app intended to help delivery drivers make their lives a little easier.

---
## Description
The idea for this app came from a friend of mine who works delivering shipments to company warehouses. He said he wanted an app that could provide information on:
* Which loading dock is for the company recieving the order (as many aren't marked with the business)
* Whether the business is front or back loading
* (Potentially) an option to review the business (Like a customer service rating)

## Language Information
Front end client is built using React, while backend will use the combination of Mongoose and MongodB.
